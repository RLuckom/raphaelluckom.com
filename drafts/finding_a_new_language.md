I love the week or so I always have before I start a new job. It's my
chance to reflect on what I learned at the last job and what I can do
better at the next one. I'm in one of those weeks now, and I'm thinking
about tools and languages.

My next job title is "Senior Devops Engineer." As an English major, I
feel qualified to assert that "devops" is not a meaningful word. Not
in the pedantic "it's not in the dictionary" sense--people who write
dictionaries don't have any special right to decide what is and isn't
a word--but in the more important sense that when you use a word 
whose meaning can be debated on Hacker News, you're likely to get into
arguments with the kind of people who get into debates on Hacker News,
and then, as they say, you have two problems.
