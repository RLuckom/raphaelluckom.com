This is how I think things change:

Every day, you exit the same train station. There's a guy on the corner. He has a sandwichboard
reading "GRAVITY IS A CHOICE" and a fistful of folded leaflets. You go to work.

One day, you come out of the train station, and the guy is two stories up one of the buildings
on the corner. He's standing on the side of the building as if on the ground, at right angles
to everyone else. Someone makes a joke about his commitment. You go to work.

The following day, the guy is gone, but a sign has appeared. It reads, "Please keep on the
sidewalk." It _doesn't_ say, "No Walking On The Side Of Buildings." That would be crazy. You
go to work.

It all comes to a head later that week, when the quarterly earnings call for a major
corporation is interrupted by a skateboarder gliding across the boardroom window in a
stately arc, making only a quiet _click click click_ going over the gaps between the big
panes. This event comes to be described as a "security incident."

The problem is, it's _useful_ space, you know? And it doesn't _exactly_ belong to anyone.
There's some room for self-interested interpretation. The people who are most comfortable
with self-interested interpretations start to assert exclusive control of it. This works out
pretty well for them in the short, medium, and long terms.

The ground remains the prime surface for most people. Travel between adjacent buildings is
something no one has quite figured out, so most trips include the street. And probably 70% of
people never go sideways at all. But walking sideways has become a common sight; the big
delivery companies have started requiring it in their job descriptions.

They say that if you haven't done it before, you should stand against a wall and feel yourself
lying down. Start to bend at the waist. You should feel two forces. One is gravity. The other
is _no_. It is the impossibility of this being true, the number of certain things that this
will make not-certain. It is the catastrophe that will retrospectively have befallen you; your
having been one way for such a long time and now being another. You can't _overcome_ _no_,
exactly. _No_ has a point. You lose something in this, whatever you do.
