I'm working on building an alternative to existing social media, based
on the premise that it is not only possible, but practical and inexpensive,
for anyone to run for themselves the suite of services provided by corporate
social networks at such a high social cost.

I do not, if I am honest, expect this to make very much of a difference.
"Like, a social network, but a better one" is the Ur-joke software engineers
tell about the ideas you hear from suits. From the non-STEM side, the
temperature feels about the same--computers are so obviously at the center
of the nuclear chain reaction occurring in global capitalism that they
seem guilty by association. The idea of an out-of-work software 
"engineer" deciding that _now_, of all times, a project like this is
a useful thing to do--well, it fits a certain nebulous-but-unkind
stereotype.

So here are the reasons I'm doing it anyway:

1. Seems fun. I was feeling pretty burned out when I left my last job,
   but now I'm finding myself really enjoying being back to putting a
   system together. Which brings me to the next reason:
2. I really, honest-to-goodness, want a non-sucky way to share stuff
   I make and stories I can tell. None of the existing social networks
   provide anything close to the quality of experience we ought to expect
   from a medium with the potential of the internet.
3. Apart from not providing a good service, the incentives that exist for
   privately-owned, for-profit social networks make them fundamentally
   untrustworthy as the major custodians of public life in a democracy.
4. I don't think that software writers as a profession have done an
   adequate job of explaining how modern software systems work. Many
   crafts have visible enthusiast cults--we affirm the aesthetic value
   of products like cars, articles of clothing, home goods--all of the
   things we interact with daily. This aesthetic consciousness doesn't
   yet seem to extend to software systems, which makes it very difficult
   to distinguish between the physical rules that apply in reality and
   the deliberately-designed rules that apply in software. Many people
   have a kind of harried awareness of being surveilled on all sides (this
   is perfectly justified), but few appreciate how fragile that panopticon
   is, and how dependent it is on willing cooperation. I'm not the first
   to hurl an oversized balloon clawhammer at those walls with malice 
   aforethought, but I intend at least to keep the tradition alive.
   [_muffled squeaking recedes_]

Along the way, I'm going to try to provide as much entertainment and
useful information as I can. If you have questions or there's something you'd
like to collaborate on or learn more about, feel free to get in touch.
