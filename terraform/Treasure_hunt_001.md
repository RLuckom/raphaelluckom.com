This is the second post I’m doing using my system “on the go”. I made some UI improvements based on
my notes from last time and I want to test them out.

Today’s treasure hunt will take me north, over the bridge from Salem into Beverly, where I’ll be
looking along the Bass River for flint or chert. After last time I talked to some experts who
suggested looking along north-south waterways for glacial cobble brought here from Maine and Vermont
in the most recent ice age.

There’s a little goldfinch in the lavender. I wanted to see if I could get a picture of it before it
flew away, using the blog interface. Success! Below is the view towards Salem from the Beverly side
of the bridge.

The tideline on the riverside looks about like this:

I found this one little piece of something that almost seems like chert, but I’m not
sure:

I didn’t find anything else on this trip, but I had a nice walk and it wasn’t too sunny. On the way
home it rained, and I needed that.

As far as the authoring UI goes, this was a pretty good day. The changes I made to make images work
better were a success. I need to make deselecting images within the post a little neater. I may try
to make my next post a how-to about something.
